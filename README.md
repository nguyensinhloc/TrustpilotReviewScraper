```
### Required Argument
- `domain`: The domain to scrape reviews for, without the need for a flag. It is the first positional argument.

### Optional Arguments
- `--stars [N ...]`: Filter reviews by star ratings. Accepts multiple values. For instance, `--stars 4 5` will only fetch reviews rated with 4 or 5 stars.

- `--date`: Filter reviews by date. Options include 'last30days', 'last3months', 'last6months' and 'last12months'. Example usage: `--date last30days`.

- `--search`: Filter reviews by a search keyword. Example usage: `--search "excellent service"`.

- `--languages`: Specify the language of reviews to fetch (e.g., 'en' for English, 'es' for Spanish). The default is 'all', which collects reviews in all languages. Example usage: `--languages en`.

- `--verified`: If used, the script will only fetch reviews that are verified. No additional value needs to be specified. Example usage: `--verified`.

- `--replies`: If used, the script will only fetch reviews that have replies. No additional value needs to be specified. Example usage: `--replies`.

- `--sort-by`: Specify the field to sort reviews by. Options include 'rating', 'date', etc. The default is 'published_date'. Example usage: `--sort-by rating`.

- `--sort-order`: Specify the order to sort reviews in. Options are 'asc' for ascending and 'desc' for descending. The default is 'asc'. Example usage: `--sort-order desc`.

- `--output`: Choose the output format of the scraped data. Options are 'csv', 'json', or 'both'. The default is 'csv'. Example usage: `--output both`.

### Example Usage Commands and Outputs

Below are examples of how to use the script along with a description of expected outputs:

- Fetch reviews for domain `example.com` with only 5-star ratings, sorted by rating in descending order, and output to
  JSON:

```sh
python trustpilot.py example.com --stars 5 --sort-by rating --sort-order desc --output json
```

Expected output:

- A JSON file `reviews_example.json` will be created with content structured as follows:

```json
[
   {
      "title": "Great service!",
      "content": "The service was amazing. Highly recommended.",
      "rating": 5,
      "date": "2023-10-01",
      "verified": true,
      "language": "en"
   },
   ...
]
```

- Fetch reviews for domain `example.com` over the last 30 days with replies, save as both CSV and JSON:

```sh
python trustpilot.py example.com --date last30days --replies --output both
```

Expected outputs:

- CSV file `reviews_example.csv` and JSON file `reviews_example.json` containing the requested review data.

## Archived Outputs

When the script processes reviews, output files are stored locally in the working directory based on the selected
format.

- **CSV File Structure**:
  Example CSV structure for scraped reviews:

| Title          | Content                    | Rating | Date       | Verified | Language |
|----------------|----------------------------|--------|------------|----------|----------|

```
Keyword Analysis:
- "amazing": 15 occurrences
- "service": 27 occurrences
